# Quick Guide to Using Github

### Welcome to Github | The Basics

A few steps to make Github easier to follow. 

- [ ] **Disable Email Notifications** (they get very overwhelming)
    - [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile) > [Notification Center](https://github.com/settings/notifications) > [ ] Email

- [ ] **Choose the repositories you want to watch** (Github automatically subscribes you to all) 
    - https://github.com/watching

- [ ] **Add Github's Notification page to your favorites** (this is the easiest place to follow issues on a daily basis) 
    - https://github.com/notifications

- [ ] Chrome users, **download this [awesome plug-in](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-issues-sticky-head/ddhgbefljpkiicgmkcjeigobonccagjh) created by @pierre-elie**
    - It makes the title of the Github issue sticky. Super useful for very long Github issues (you often forget what the issue is about once you've scrolled all the way to the bottom).

### Staying on top of notifications

On the [notification page](https://github.com/notifications), Github automatically sorts your notifications into 2 buckets: `Unread` (all unread notifications) and `Participating` (issues where you were mentioned at least once, issues you're assigned to and issues you created)

Going to your `Participating` page lets you cut through the noise and see only issues that are relevant to you. If you feel an issue is not relevant to you anymore, you can **mark it as read** without opening it, directly from the Notifications Page (check mark on the right of the issue). You can also **unsubscribe from issues** to stop notifications:   

- either from the Notification Page directly

- or from the right panel inside of the issue

Note: You will automatically be resubscribed to the issue the next time you are mentioned.

### Some Github etiquette

This is mostly to avoid unnecessary notifications and noise + keep issues focused. 

- When creating new issues, make sure the title clearly describes what the issue is about. Most people only scan issues' titles from the notifications page. Good practice, start the title with the name of the relevant app view. e.g `Calendar Day View > Title of issue` or `Email List > Title of issue`. 

- Also create issues in the most relevant repo and add labels, milestones and assignee when possible. 
 
- If you're expecting a response from someone in particular, mention him/her in a comment (using `@` + username) to make sure he/she gets pinged and get reply to you quickly. 

- You can also mention entire teams at once (@outlook/ui, @outlook/ux, @outlook/backend...). Please only use these when you really need feedback from the entire team though to avoid unnecessary notifications to everyone.

- Comments with just a :+1: or a :goat: are awesome but can create unnecessary noise. Keep your comments useful as much as possible.  

- If you feel like an issue is getting sidetracked, please open a new issue to keep the new conversation there and refocus the current conversation on the actual subject of the issue. 

- If it's relevant, add screenshots as much as possible when trying to explain something. Pictures tell a thousand words right?

### Searching for issues

Searching for issues can feel difficult in Github. Not difficult enough for you to abandon though. Here are a few quick tips to help. 

- Just putting your keywords in the plain Github search bar won't help. It actually searches all of Github when you do that.

- If you know which repository the issue you're looking for is in, the easiest way to search for it is to go directly in that repository. The search function will then be focused only on the repo you're in.

- If you don't know where the issue is (which is probably why you're searching for it), simply add the following keywords before the keyword of your choice: `user:outlook type:issue`

- Last tip, use this link to see all issues assigned to you. 
https://github.com/outlook/product/issues/assigned/`your-github-name`. Easily filter it to current milestone and you'll have the to-do list you've always dreamed of.
