## Milestones

- Check out the milestones of the different repositories to see what's coming up next. Here are the [Product Milestones](https://github.com/sunrise/product/milestones) as an example
- Check out what is everyone working on at the moment [here](https://github.com/sunrise/team)
- Ask your manager or colleague to tell you what the main repos mean (Product/Marketing/Team/iOS etc) and when/how we use each of them

## Prioritizing Across Repositories

- Use Wunderlist (Create a Github To-Do Project) and add the several issues you're working on with the actual issues as a subtask h/t @arisawyers.
